Towards the integration of environmental DNA analysis to profile the upper mesopelagic fish layer in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean
This repository contains the bioinformatic pipeline and R scripts used to analyse eDNA metabarcoding data and produce graphical outputs for the paper that can be found at this DOI: 10.1093/icesjms/fsae152
The bioinformatics folder contains one file with the script to run the bioinformatic processing of the ONT data obtained from the Mk1C sequencer (already demultiplexed). This script uses the decona pipeline (https://github.com/Saskia-Oosterbroek/decona/tree/master). All analyses were run on a Lenovo Thinkpad L14 (64 GB RAM, AmD Ryzen Pro 7 x 16 processor) with Ubuntu 22.04.4.
The R scripts folder contains three scripts: "maps" contains the script used to produce the map of the survey location, "data visualisation" contains the script used to produce all graphical outputs for the paper and supplementary materials, "PCoAs" contains the script used for the PCoA analysis and graphical outputs. This folder also contains all the csv files necessary for the analysis.
